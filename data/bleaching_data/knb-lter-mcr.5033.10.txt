       During 2016, maximum water temperature in the lagoons of Moorea exceeded a threshold for
        heat stress for 70 straight days from early February through mid-April. In early May 2016,
        at the peak of accumulated heat stress, coral bleaching surveys were conducted to test the
        hypothesis that bleaching prevalence and severity were correlated with differences in heat
        stress and nutrient availability. 
       This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under
        Grant No. OCE 16-37396 (and earlier awards) as well as a generous gift from the Gordon and
        Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian
        Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en
        Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2019). This work represents a
        contribution of the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER Site.

            We surveyed 167 sites around Moorea and recorded bleaching on colonies of
                        Pocillopora and Acropora, which
                    were present at 149 of the sites. Sites were at least 0.5 km apart, and at each
                    site two snorkelers conducted 10-minute swims in opposite directions recording
                    all observed colonies of Pocillopora and
                        Acropora. Sites were distributed around the entire
                    island, and were categorized by habitat (fringing reef and back reef) and by the
                    dominant cardinal direction of the coastline (North, East, West). We surveyed
                    the two most common and widespread genera of branching corals in the system,
                        Acropora and Pocillopora. The most
                    common Acropora species were Acropora hyacinthus, 
                    Acropora retusa, and
                    Acropora clathrata, while the most common
                        Pocillopora species were Pocillopora
                        verrucosa, Pocillopora meandrina, and
                        Pocillopora eydouxi. Pocillopora
                        damicornis and Acropora pulchra were present
                    at some sites but were not included in the surveys since they were largely
                    restricted to the fringing reef sites. For each colony, we estimated the water
                    depth (from 0-3 m deep), and its size class (size classes were 0-10 cm diameter,
                    11-20 cm, 21-30 cm, 31-40 cm, >40 cm). We then recorded whether bleaching was
                    present (prevalence), and if so, estimated the percentage of the colony surface
                    area that was bleached (severity). Because corals undergo natural, seasonal
                    variation in Symbiodiniaceae density that can affect their coloration, we
                    defined bleached tissue only as tissue that had lost all pigmentation. 
            To assess nitrogen availability at each site, we measured the N content in the
                    long-lived brown macroalga Turbinaria ornata at each site. The nutrient content
                    of macroalgae is often used as a proxy for ambient nutrient conditions as these
                    macroalgae integrate nutrients over a relatively long time frame (i.e., weeks to
                    months). During January and May 2016, we sampled 10 individual thalli of T.
                        ornata at each site around the island for analysis of N content while we also
                    surveyed coral bleaching (there was minimal bleaching in January 2016). Samples
                    were immediately placed on ice and transported to the lab. One blade from each
                    thallus was sampled at 5 cm below the apical tip of the thallus. These blades
                    were scrubbed of epiphytes and briefly rinsed with fresh water before being
                    dried at 60°C to a constant weight and ground to powder. Total N content was
                    determined via elemental analysis using a CHN Carlo-Erba elemental analyzer
                    (NA1500) CN Analyzer at the University of Georgia, Center for Applied Isotope
                    Studies. We also measured δN15 in the tissues of T. ornata at the Marine Science
                    Institute Analytical Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
                    using standard elemental analyzer isotope ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS)
                    procedures. We averaged values from January and May to represent nutrient
                    conditions throughout the Austral summer.
            The following is from the 
              NOAA Coral Reef Watch Methodology Page
            :
              Coral Bleaching Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) 
              accumulates any HotSpots greater than 1 °C over a 12- week window, thus showing how stressful conditions have been for 
              corals in the last three months. It is a cumulative measurement of the intensity and duration of thermal stress, and is 
              expressed in the unit °C-weeks. DHWs over 4 °C-weeks have been shown to cause significant coral bleaching; values over 
              8 °C-weeks have caused widespread bleaching and some mortality.
