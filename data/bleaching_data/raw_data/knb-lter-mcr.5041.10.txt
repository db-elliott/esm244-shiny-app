      These data are from field surveys conducted at seven sites at 10m depth on the outer reef of Mo’orea following a marine heatwave and coral bleaching event in the Austral Summer of 2019. These data describe the size, percent of the colony that was bleached, and the percent of the colony that recently dead for corals in the genera Acropora and Pocillopora. At six sites (LTER 1-6) coral colony size was quantified using ordinal size bins and observers collected data on all coral colonies > 5cm diameter. At one site on the north shore of Mo’orea (LTER Experimental Site) coral colony size was measured to the nearest centimeter. At this site researchers did two separate sets of surveys, one to collect data on all corals > 5cm diameter, and one to collect data on all individuals ≤ 5cm diameter. 
      
      Additionally, data on survivorship of newly-settled coral recruits on coral settlement tiles are included. Tiles were deployed at 10m depth at one site on the outer reef of Moorea. Survivorship of coral recruits between March and July was assessed in 2017 and 2019.
      
      These data are in support of a publication Speare et al. (2021) Global Change Biology.

          All benthic surveys were conducted along the 10 m isobath on the outer reef of Mo’orea. On July 9-15, 2019, approximately 2 months after the peak of accumulated heat stress, two divers on SCUBA conducted coral bleaching and mortality surveys at six sites on the outer reef, with two sites on each side of the island. Pocillopora are substantially more abundant than Acropora so we employed slightly different survey methods for the two genera. At each site, divers surveyed Pocillopora and Acropora along two 50 m transects, in which divers quantified bleaching and mortality for every Pocillopora that intercepted the transect. Corals were identified to genus. Each colony was binned into one of three size bins (5-9 cm, 10-29 cm, 30+ cm), and the percent that was bleached and recently dead was then estimated for each colony. Portions of colonies were considered ‘recently dead’ if they were visibly colonized by turf algae but not yet colonized by macroalgae. In some instances there were several corals in the same area that had the same colony characteristics (size bin, percent dead, etc.) and in these instances we indicated the number of colonies in the “Count” column. Therefore the count column is a row multiplier.
        
      
      
        
          We conducted more size-explicit coral bleaching and mortality surveys of corals using finer scale resolution of colony size from July 30 – August 7, 2019. Due to the time-intensive nature of these surveys, we conducted them only at one site (the LTER Experimental Site) on the outer reef of the north shore of Moorea. Two SCUBA divers conducted 10, 15 x 1 m-belt transects in which they visually estimated bleaching and mortality for every colony > 5 cm diameter using the same methods as described earlier. For these surveys, we measured the longest diameter of each colony to the nearest centimeter using a meter stick with centimeter markings. We then surveyed the same transects a second time to quantify bleaching and mortality of juvenile corals 1-5 cm diameter. We conducted the first several transects as 1 m belt transects, but then modified the method for later transects to use a 2 m belt to capture data on more individuals. The belt width for each transect is denoted in the “BeltSize” column. We measured the diameter of each coral to the nearest centimeter using a ruler, and visually estimated the percent of the colony that was bleached and recently dead. The processing code for this dataset is listed in the manuscript.
        
      
      
        
          Limestone coral settlement tiles were deployed in August 2018 and accumulated naturally-settled recruits. Newly-settled coral recruits are notoriously difficult to identify while alive so it was not possible to identify the recruits on our tiles to genus. In March 2019, coral settlement tiles were collected from the reef daily in groups of eight and transported to the wet lab at the Richard B. Gump research station in a cooler of seawater. The surfaces of each tile were digitally photographed (Olympus Stylus Touch TG-4 camera). We searched each tile for coral recruits using a dissecting microscope and the location of each individual recruit was marked and numbered on the digital photos of each tile. Tiles were kept submerged in seawater throughout this process and returned to the reef within 24 hours of collection. Tiles were returned to the reef for 4 months and collected again in July 2019. We searched these tiles again for coral recruits, looking specifically in locations where the recruits were previously mapped. Recruits that were mapped in March were then scored as either Alive or Dead in July. We computed mean survival for each tile (n=34). The settlement tiles that were scored in 2019 were part of a factorial in situ experiment that artificially manipulated herbivore abundance (via herbivore exclusion) and nutrient enrichment (via nutrient diffusers filled with Osmocote slow-release fertilizer), and adult coral community disturbance (adult corals removed or adult coral community intact). In 2017, we tracked coral recruit survival during the same timeframe (March-July) using the same methods (n=12 tiles). Tiles used in 2017 were not part of the factorial experiment.
