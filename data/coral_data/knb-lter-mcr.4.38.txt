      This dataset contains the percentage cover of the stony corals (Scleractinia) and other
        major groups analyzed from 0.5 x 0.5 m photographic quadrats in several reef habitats at the
        Moorea Coral Reef LTER, French Polynesia. This survey has been repeated annually in April
        since 2005. There are two tables available, providing different views of the same data: a
        long table having all values in one column and a wide table having a separate column for
        each dependent variable. Functional groups (i.e., dependent variables) counted are: Scleractinian Corals (by genus where
        appropriate, see methods), Macroalgae, Crustose Coralline Algae / Bare Space, Soft Corals,
        Hydrocorals (Millepora), Algal Turf and Sand. The coral community was sampled
        photographically in all habitats surrounding the island: Fringing Reef, Lagoon (Backreef),
        and Outer Reef (Forereef.) The sampling regime consists of a repeated-measures protocol in each
        habitat, and is structured by habitat to allow a statistical contrast of sites, shores,
        times, and in the case of the outer reef, depths. Detailed methods are available in the
        protocols section.
       This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under
        Grant No. OCE 16-37396 (and earlier awards) as well as a generous gift from the Gordon and
        Betty Moore Foundation. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian
        Government (Délégation à la Recherche) and the Haut-commissariat de la République en
        Polynésie Francaise (DTRT) (Protocole d'Accueil 2005-2020). This work represents a
        contribution of the Moorea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER Site.

            Photoquadrats
            Quantitative high resolution digital images.
          
          
            Sampling
            The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time, shore, 
              and
              depth on the coral community structure of the fringing, and outer reef habitats of
              Moorea. For the purpose of this analysis, fringing communities were defined as reefs
              adjacent to the shore and within ca. 50 m of the land. Outer reef habitats were
              censused at 10 and 17 m depth in order to sample habitats that are representative of
              the outer reefs of Moorea, and within the depth range tractable to diving research.
              The project was designed with 40 quadrats at each site/depth combination, but
              sometimes this number was not achieved because all quadrats did not fit in the space
              measured between markers (a perpetual effect once the site was established in 2005),
              or quadrats were missed in error on the sampling day (unique to each year). To
              facilitate field sampling, the 40m transect was recorded in 5 contiguous sectors that
              are not independent (one begins where the previous ends) and are not intended to be a
              factor in the statistical design. The original design was based on a 
               nested, factorial ANOVA model in which Shore (north, southeast, or southwest) is
              a fixed factor, site (LTER 1-6) a random factor nested within shore, and
              time a repeated measures factor based on individual quadrats that are relocated
              annually (at the fringe and outer sites). In the case of the outer reef, depth (10 or
              17 m) also was used as a fixed factor to contrast the effects of time and
              shore between depths. All census methods were designed to quantify coral community
              structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community -
              scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, algal turf, Millepora, and
              sand. The scleractinian community structure was classified to genus,
              or in one case family (Fungidae in the more recent sampling). 
              
              In addition to
              establishing an orthogonal contrast of coral community structure, a subset of the
              sites and habitats were selected for more detailed analyses of the population density
              of coral recruits and juvenile corals, as well as the demographic analysis of selected
              coral species. The time-consuming nature of these analyses prevented them from being
              measured in all site/habitat combinations.
          
          
             Quality Control issues in benthic community analysis
             This data set is based on photographic images recorded using a 0.5 x 0. 5 m
              photoquadrat and a high resolution SLR digital camera. From 2005 to 2018 the raw images have increased in size six-fold in megapixels from 6 to 36, 
              although images analyzed images are slightly smaller after cropping to the framer size
              
              For the outer reef and fringing
              reef sampling, photoquadrats are repositioned each year at the same spot along the 40
              m long transect. The corners of the quadrats are not marked. The photoquadrat
              is placed in the same position along the transect 
              each year, but currents and waves can result
              in repositioning errors. To screen for these effects, matched photographs in
              consecutive years are evaluated using a software routine for detecting changes in coral cover
              that exceed 20%; such changes are unlikely to occur through biological processes
              (although they could arise from importation of colonies following storms). All
              photographs at each site are compared with matched images in the following year, and
              discrepancies of >20% coral cover are flagged for investigation. Typically <1%
              of the images require further investigation each year. 
            Due to site-specific issues at the LTER 4 Fringing Reef site, accurate quadrat
              relocation has not been consistent over the time series. Thus specific quadrat photos
              should not be considered as repeated locations from one year to the next at this site. However
              transect location has remained consistent, allowing for site level time series
              analysis.
          
          
            Parameters for Photoquadrat Analysis
            Prior to 2008, the area of benthic taxa was quantified by superimposing a matrix
              of 200 randomly located dots on the image and counting the dots landing on the
              substratum category of interest. From 2008-2014 CPCe software was used to quantify the
              area of benthic taxa using a matrix of 200 randomly spaced dots that were 15 pixels in
              diameter. From 2015-present, image analysis was done using the CoralNet web based
              application developed by researches at UCSD (http://coralnet.ucsd.edu/about/), without
              automated annotations. A matrix of 200 randomly spaced dots generated by CoralNet were
              overlaid on the area of benthic taxa. Points were classified without alleviate mode so
              that 100% classification is done by human decision. Each dot was classified by one individual
              technician from 2005-2007, a second individual from 2008-2015, and a third individual
              from 2016-present.
          
          
            Classification Change History
            A data table is provided to inform data users of various taxonomic or functional
              group changes to the classification. A row for each cover category (genus, species, or
              functional group) has one column added for each year of this time series, and entries
              in this column indicate the category used and whether it has changed. Examples of
              changes include simple name changes such as Dipsastrea to Goniastrea in 2016, or more
              profound changes such as resolving Porites into 3 different Porites taxa or functional
              groups in 2010. The attached metadata file will allow users to distinguish how
              groupings changed over time. Users may wish to keep the resolution provided or may
              choose to pool categories as appropriate for their analyses.
