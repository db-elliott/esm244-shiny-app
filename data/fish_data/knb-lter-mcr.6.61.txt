      These data describe the species abundance and size distributions of fishes surveyed as part of MCR LTER's annual reef fish monitoring program. This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids, Serranids, etc.) observed on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids, Cirrhitids, Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006, divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides), six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small, stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 12m, those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m. In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state, swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visability in m. This monitoring program is consistent with the protocols adopted by the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network and the Australian Institute of Marine Science for use with the Great Barrier Reef Long-term Monitoring Program.

        Grant No. OCE 16-37396 (and earlier awards) as well as a generous gift from the Gordon and

            Diver Observation
            This study began in 2005 and the dataset is updated annually. The
							abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids, Labrids, Acanthurids,
							Serranids, etc.) observed on on a five by fifty meter transect which
							extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded
							by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty
							meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances
							of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids, Gobiids,
							Cirrhitids, Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and
							1600 hours (Moorea local time) during late July or early August each
							year. In 2006, divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each
							fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are
							surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of
							Moorea's three sides), six locations on the backreef (two on each
							of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef
							(two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual
							transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small,
							stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are
							located at a depth of approximately 12m, those on the backreef are
							located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef
							are located at a depth of approximately 10m. 
          
          
            Locations
             Annual fish census locations are labeled with four components in a
							stratified design: 6 sites, 3 habitats, 4 transects, 2 swaths. (The
							swaths are the transect widths of 1 m and 5 m.) Therefore there are 144
							unique locations surveyed each year. The six MCR-LTER sites span the
							three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and
							2 on the north-facing shore, Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-facing
							shore, and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore. At each site,
							the three habitats are the Fringing Reef, Backreef, and Forereef. At
							each habitat, there are four transects. Each transect has two swaths.
							The two swaths are described in the Diver Observation method step.
						
          Use of the term transect here will be further clarified in the next 
            revision of this dataset's methods. Correspondence with the author is encouraged in the meantime.
          
          
          
            Dive Conditions
             In addition to the biotic data collected, divers also record data on
							the date and time each transect was surveyed, wind speed and sea state,
							swell height in m, amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visibility
							in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive, which is unique to a
							habitat at a site for a year. Therefore there are 18 unique dive
							conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites). 
          
          
            Divers
             At each site, at each habitat, there are four transects, each covered
							by an assigned diver (in 2005 by 2 divers). Whenever possible, the same
							diver covers the same transect number every year. (Transect 3 has
							varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. (In 2005, the initials
							of 2 divers are concatenated.) The diver ID is determined by the year
							and transect number; there are 4 unique diver IDs for each year. 
          
          
             Reference for fish census protocol
             The MCR-LTER annual fish census is based on the 'Fish Belt Transect'
							method described in: 'Methods for Ecological Monitoring Of Coral Reefs:
							A Resource For Managers. Version 1.', J. Hill and C. Wilkinson, 2004,
							Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), Townsville, Australia.

            Estimation of biomass from length
            
							Calculated fish biomass is a wet weight. 
							Fish biomass (body weight in g) is estimated using the formula w = aL^b 
							where L is the fish fork length (FL) in cm and parameters a and b depend on species.
							Parameters were obtained primarily from Kulbicki et al. 2005. 
							
							Diver observations of fish length are collected and reported in this dataset as total length. 
							The conversion to fork length was determined primarily using FishBase.

              Initial Survey
              This study began in 2005 with an initial survey. Protocol and data
								collected differ from the annual survey in subsequent years. Size
								(fish length) was not collected in 2005.
               In the initial survey in 2005, the Forereef habitat transects at
								sites LTER 1 and LTER 2 were replicated three times. All other sites
								and habitats have one replicate.
            
            
              Divers
               At each site, at each habitat, there are four transects, each
								covered by a pair of assigned divers in 2005.
